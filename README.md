1. Open the BetterAnchors options. You can do this by typing `/ba` in the chat or by clicking the BetterAnchors icon on your minimap.

2. Navigate to your WeakAuras (WA) settings. You can do this by typing `/wa` in the chat.

3. In the WA settings, find the aura you want to anchor to a BetterAnchors frame. Click on it to open its settings.
